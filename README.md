# SPLED: Software Product Line Engineering Demo

![Alt text](doc/_figures/SPLED_logo.png)

This demo repository contains a tiny but fully fledged [SPL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_product_line) for SW development. It is capable of holding a set of software modules that are differently used and configured among the variants. Each variant creates its own binaries.

## CI (Continuous Integration)

* [![selftests](https://github.com/avengineers/spldemo/actions/workflows/test.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/avengineers/spldemo/actions/workflows/test.yml)
* artifacts are archived under Github Actions (or locally inside the `build/<variant>/(prod|test)` directory)
